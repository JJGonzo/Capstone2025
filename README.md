Repo for UWSP Capstone 2025 
This project focuses on developing an automated OSINT toolkit to help organizations or individuals gather and analyze intelligence from the dark web. Companies, cybersecurity teams, or law enforcement agencies could use this tool to monitor illicit activities, track threat actors, and analyze discussions on underground forums. Additionally, university students and researchers can use these tools to research hard to find information on the web. 

Upon completion of this project, a customized importable Image will be presented to the client. This image will be an asset for use within the IA Lab professor Johnson uses during courses involving OSINT and threat intelligence. 

Monitoring the dark web manually is time-consuming, inefficient, and risky. Analysts must manually browse hidden forums and marketplaces, extract relevant data, and try to identify threats. This approach takes too long, exposes researchers to security risks, and lacks scalability.  

This toolkit will automate web scraping and data analysis from the dark web. It will extract and structure information such as usernames, cryptocurrency addresses, and discussion topics, making it easier to analyze and identify risks saving companies time and money.
